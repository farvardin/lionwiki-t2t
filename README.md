## About LionWiki 

**LionWiki** was a minimalist Wiki engine programmed in PHP, based on [WiKiss](http://www.wikiss.tuxfamily.org/), itself based on TigerWiki...

It revives now in this txt2tags-based implementation.

It is extensible, templatable, file based (it doesn't need database like MySQL) and requires just one file to function (30 kb). It is suitable for small websites, personal notebooks or journals. 

## About txt2tags 

**[Txt2tags](http://www.txt2tags.org)** is a document generator and a lightweight markup.

It is very **extensible** and **customisable**, by using regex and preprocessors.

Its php implementation targets only HTML but you can use it with several CMS, Blog and wiki engines: *Wordpress, Drupal, Dotclear, Dokuwiki, **LionWiki***...
