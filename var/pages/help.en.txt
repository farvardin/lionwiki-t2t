Lionwiki-t2t is a wiki system for the creation and maintenance of websites. 

Lionwiki-t2t pages looks the same as normal webpages, but in addition they have an "Edit" link which helps to edit or add new pages on a website, with a lightweight markup language, like for http://www.wikipedia.org.

Based on Lionwiki-t2t, this present system has some ready to use extensions and a simplified syntax.



%%toc 



== Presentation ==

The pages on this site are wiki-based pages, which means that pages can be created and edited by multiple authors. To edit a page, click on the "edit" link which exists somewhere on the page (generally at the top or in the footer). Some pages may be protected by a password.

In this wiki, the default password is "demo". It is adviced to modify it after the installation (see below).

When you edit a page, you see the markup which describe the content of the page. The final rendering, with the choosen formatting, will be displayed only after the page is saved.

Lionwiki-t2t and txt2tags are not [[(Wikipedia:)WYSIWYG]] - When editing a page, you see the //markup text// that describes the content of the page.  The basic rules for page markup are simple (you will find them below).


== Editing rules (syntax) ==


The syntax of this wiki is following the general rules of txt2tags syntax, which you can find [here as a reminder http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/markup.html].
The idea is you should be able to paste here your txt2tags documents without many modifications (explained in the second part of this document).


== Complete syntax ==



- ""**bold**""      :  **bold**
- ""//italic//""   :  //italic//
- ""__underline__"" :  __underline__
- ""--strike--""      :  --strike--
- ``=`` surrounding your titles / headings (at different levels)
- ""- list""
- ""+ numbered list""
- ""``code``""
- ""% comment"" (after % won't be interpreted)
- ``[http://www.website.org/image.jpg]`` : [http://www.pmwiki.org/pmwiki/pub/skins/pmwiki/pmwiki-32.gif]
- ""[link to an external site http://www.site.com]"" :  [link to an external site http://www.site.com]
- ""| tableau | cell 2 | cell 3 |"" :  will work in condition there is an even number of ``|``

| table | cell 2 | cell 3 |
| table | cell 2 | cell 3 |

| table | cell 2 | cell 3 | cell 4 ||
| table | cell 2 | cell 3 | cell 4 ||

== Installation ==

Lionwiki is easy to install, no need to setup a sql database: a webserver (Apache, Lighttpd or Nginx) + php will be enough.

Here is what is possible to do:

- install web server + lionwiki (``apt-get install php5-sqlite apache2 libapache2-mod-php5``) 
 - cd /var/www 
 - wget http://wiki.txt2tags.org/demos/lionwiki-t2t-minimal.zip
 - unzip lionwiki-t2t-minimal.zip


== Synchronize ==

To synchronise your wiki with your mobile devices, install this in addition:

- (optionnal) install owncloud : http://owncloud.org/
- (optionnal) share a subfolder containing your lionwiki install into owncloud
- install [foldersync https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.full] on an android device and synchronise the text files into var/pages/ between your server and your device (tablet, smartphone), using either ssh (recommended) or owncloud.
 - Alternatively, you can try http://git-annex.branchable.com/assistant/ instead of foldersync
- install for example the [920 text editor https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jecelyin.editor] on android and edit the pages of your website from your mobile device!




== Use ==

- top menu: you can customise your menu by editing the menu.php file in the root. Sorry we couldn't make it editable online. Maybe later.
- general configuration: see config.php
- special configurations, regex etc: you can add extra customisation in your wiki by using the config.t2t file
 - you can have a look at [[sandbox_cyoa]] and its configuration file cyoa.t2t for an example of a special customisation using this feature. 
- you can edit the whole wiki (including conf files and index.php) by extracting the editor.zip in the root. Beware, it might be a security breach so you'd better at least rename the folder to something not obvious.


== Avantages ==

__Some advantages__:

- data are stored in plain text, which are human readable and can be edited from an other application (for example a text editor on your smartphone)
- simple and sober default theme (minimaxing). CSS using responsive design (for smartphone and tablets). You can easily customise colors using [less http://lesscss.org/].
- Another option theme is using [bootstrap http://getbootstrap.com], so you can use it as a basis for a modern website.





== Tips ==

- if you need to make your image left, right or centered aligned, keep this in mind:
 - for left align, add an extra space (and/or some text) after the image mark
 - for center align, add an extra space (and/or some text) before and after the image mark
 - for right align, add an extra space (and/or some text) before the image mark

- if you need to work further on the minimaxing design, rename in the template minimaxing.html the call to minimaxing.css to minimaxing.less

- you can use you own handwriting font, just name it MyManuscript.ttf, put it in the templates/fonts folder (replace the existing one) and change the css/less file so it will be called before the other fonts.

- You can also use your favorite font, rename if MyFont.ttf and put it in the templates/fonts folder (replace the existing one).

- On linux or mac os x, it shouldn't be a problem to double-click on a word and only highlight that word, while on windows it would select also the white space after it, so you can't properly add the syntax. So on windows: 
 - either single click after the last character of the word and press CTRL + SHIFT + LEFT ARROW
 - or if you're on mozilla firefox, in ``about:config``, just set ``layout.word_select.eat_space_to_next_word`` to ``False``.

- the ``var/pages`` folder is protected by .htaccess. Don't forget to enable it in both your ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/default`` and ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl`` configurations!



== Known bugs ==

- if you edit a part of the document, after saving you might need to reload the page if you want to edit a new part, otherwise the edit field will remain blank.
- regex have problems with some replacements (lionwiki doesn't keep the \ in regex). Instead include a t2t file using includeconf
