'''Admin''' plugin provides advanced administration functions. It's useful for sites attacked by vandalism or spam. Because these functions are quite sensitive, they are protected by password (different from password needed to save pages). Password is required and must be set.

!Installation
The only thing needed is to set admin password in config.php file:

{{$Admin["PASSWORD"] = sha1("my_password");}}

xxx
