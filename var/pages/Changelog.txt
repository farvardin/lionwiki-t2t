

Since 2013-08-15, lionwiki-t2t is a fork of (then) lionwiki 3.2.9. It still follows the main lionwiki code when it
gets updates, if possible. 

The lionwiki author has stated "This project is dead and not recommended for use in new projects." which is a pity.

lionwiki-t2t improves the way lionwiki behave, by adding some new templates and the txt2tags syntax.
