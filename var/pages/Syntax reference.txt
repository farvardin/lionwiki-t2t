This document explains all syntax features of LionWiki-t2t, which is based on [txt2tags http://www.txt2tags.org].

This syntax is quite easy to learn, but it's also quite strict: if what you write differ a bit from the rules, the results might be unpredicable and deceptive. Try to especially take care of the spaces used in the syntax. To master the txt2tags markup efficiently, you are adviced to read [the manual which can be found there http://www.txt2tags.org/docs.html]


== Headings ==

Example:

```
CONVERT-2EQUAL Heading H2 ==
CONVERT-3EQUAL Heading H3 ===
CONVERT-4EQUAL Heading H4 CONVERT-4EQUAL
```


No extra characted, except spaces (even if I personnally  advice to avoid them, and instead to start writing the markup at the beginning of the line), are allowed before the heading markup. Spaces are not required around the part to be marked as heading, but it might be more readable this way.


== Heading H2 ==
=== Heading H3 ===
==== Heading H4 ====




== Lists ==

=== Unordered list ===

```
- Fruit
 - Apple
   - Granny smith
 - Orange
- Vegetables
 - Garlic
 - Onion
```

You must add exactly one space after each dash to enable the list.

- Fruit
 - Apple
   - Granny smith
 - Orange
- Vegetables
 - Garlic
 - Onion


=== Ordered list ===

```
+ First item 
 + First subitem 
  + First subsubitem
  + Second subsubitem
  + Third subsubitem
 + Second subitem
```

+ First item 
 + First subitem 
  + First subsubitem
  + Second subsubitem
  + Third subsubitem
 + Second subitem


== Text styles ==

- ``**``Bold``**`` --> **Bold** (two stars)
- ``//``Italic``//`` --> //Italic// (two slash)
- ``**//``Bold and italic``//**`` --> **//Bold and italic//** (combination of the above)
- ``--``Strikethrough``--`` --> --Strikethrough--
- ``__``Underlined``__`` --> __Underlined__

You can't add extra spaces at the boundaries of the part you want to mark with the styles above. This part can contain spaces (if it's a sentence), but not after the first mark, and not before the last mark : the marks must be glued with the contents.


== Tables ==

```
|| title 1  | title 2 |
|  item 1 | item 2 |
|  item 3 | item 4 |
```

{//..}

|| title 1 | title 2 |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

== Emails, links, images ==

Links to other local wiki pages can be created like this:
CONVERT-BRACKET-STARTCONVERT-BRACKET-STARTmainCONVERT-BRACKET-ENDCONVERT-BRACKET-END --> [[main]]




Emails and web links are automatically recognized:


- ``http://www.homepage.td`` --> http://www.homepage.td
- ``lionwiki@example.com`` --> lionwiki@example.com

TODO

You can use also relative links, but they have to start with ./ (otherwise it will be interpreted as Wiki page). So if you want to link some HTML page in the same directory, you use:

^[Interesting page|./SomeWebPage.html] --> [Interesting page|./SomeWebPage.html]

Or to use a relative path to a file on the same server but in a higher directory, you can use:
^[Interesting File In Parent Directory|./../SomeWebPage.html] --> [Interesting File In Parent Directory|./../SomeWebPage.html]

== Images ==

If you need a way to upload images (or other files), check [Upload plugin|UserGuide: Upload plugin].
^[^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg] --> [http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg]

You can use your image as your link: ^[^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|^link=^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/] --> 
[http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|link=http://lionwiki.0o.cz/]

You can also place your image to the left or right, possibly combined with other features:
^[^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|^link=^http://lionwiki.0o.cz/|center|title=Big Lion|alt=Alt text]

[http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|link=http://lionwiki.0o.cz/|center|title=Big Lion|alt=Alt text]
[http://lionwiki.0o.cz/lion.jpg|link=http://lionwiki.0o.cz/|right|title=Big Lion|alt=Alt text]
{br}
More complex operations with images can be done with [ImageExt plugin|UserGuide: ImageExt plugin].

!Subpages
Subpages are useful when you need to insert some common content into multiple pages, example could be a navigational menu (by the way, we have [Menu plugin|UserGuide: Menu plugin].

Syntax: ^{include:page_to_be_included}.

You can use the same syntax to include page in template (i.e. not in page content), but in this case, whole content of this subpage must be in HTML (you can, but not have to enclose it in ^{html} and ^{/html}).


!Multilingual content
Let's say you have page named "Biography" in German and you would like to make French variant. Rename page Biography to Biography.de and create page named Biography.fr and insert French translation there. Then visitors whose browser identifies primary language as French will see Biography.fr. It's recommended to create a redirect from page Biography to default language variant. The obvious limitation is that page name has to stay the same in every language variant. That's not such a big problem with "Biography", but it can be worse with other names. 

This is recommended way to create multilingual content, there are more ways to do it.

!Redirects
If you want to redirect from some page to other, put ^{redirect:page} at the very beginning of the page. It's not straightforward to edit page containing redirect because every visit will cause redirecting. The only way to edit such page is from search results (as it provides direct edit links), or possibly by manually altering URL.

!Other


== Table of contents ==
Automatically generated table of contents can be inserted with ``CONVERT-TOC`` 


== Characters ==

Some sequences of characters are automatically replaced:

- Arrows : ""--""> : -->
- Dash :  ""--""-  : ---


== Code ==

Code syntax is useful when you need to keep original spacing and layout of text



!!Horizontal line
----
by '''^--^--'''

!!Suppressing wiki syntax
By using ^^ character before syntax keyword or using ^{{something}}. If you still don't know how, take a look on wiki code of this page, there are plenty of examples. If you want to insert ^^ character, you have to double it, i.e. ^^^^

!!HTML code
Do you want to insert youtube video to your site? Or any other HTML code? Just insert it between ^{html}some html code{/html}. This does not have to work if config value $NO_HTML is set to true. Note that it is serious security risk if you allow users to post HTML code in your wiki.

!!!HTML entities
HTML entities are automatically recognized and left without modification. 

!!Newline
LionWiki joins adjacent newlines together, if you need more than one newline, use ^{br}.

!!Internal comments
You can insert internal comments not intended to be displayed using HTML-like syntax ^<!^-- text not intended to be displayed ^-->
