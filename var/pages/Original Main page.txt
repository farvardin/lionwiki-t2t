'''LionWiki''' is a minimalist Wiki engine programmed in PHP. It is extensible, templatable, file based (it doesn't need database like MySQL) and requires just one file to function. It is suitable for small websites, personal notebooks or journals.

!Download
Current version of LionWiki is 3.2.9. You can choose from two downloads:
* [Full featured LionWiki|http://lionwiki.0o.cz/download/3.2.9/lionwiki-3.2.9.tar.bz2] consisting of core file, templates, configuration file, language files and plugins.
* [Core LionWiki|http://lionwiki.0o.cz/download/3.2.9/index.txt] consisting of just one file which contains everything needed for basic functions. It is exactly the same as index.php from full featured LionWiki.

Older versions can be found [here|./download/].

The only software requirement is PHP installation with version greater or equal to 4.3. See [page on installation|UserGuide: Installation] for details.


!Development
LionWiki is considered to be finished and is not actively developed. It is however maintained and it's possible that development will be revived in the future. Help is very appreciated, especially bug reports, localizations and templates.

!!Disclaimer for developers
LionWiki was designed from the beginning to be very small and simple. It's architecture is trivial which means that it's core is quite hard to extend. It's also not suitable for studying purposes - there are a lot of examples of generally bad programming practices and PHP hacks which were used solely for sake of minimalism (to keep it as small as possible). Though, writing plugins which do not interfere with core's functionality is quite easy.
