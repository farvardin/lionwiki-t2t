About txt2tags
==============

**Txt2tags** is a document generator and a lightweight markup.

It reads a text file with minimal markup such as ``**bold**`` and ``//italic//``. Its python implementation can convert to several formats such as *html, docbook, LaTeX, RTF, Man page, Creole, Wikipedia / MediaWiki, PmWiki, DokuWiki, MoinMoin, AsciiDoc...*

It is very **extensible** and **customisable**, by using regex and preprocessors.

Its php implementation targets only HTML but you can use it with several CMS, Blog and wiki engines: *Wordpress, Drupal, Dotclear, Dokuwiki, LionWiki*...

About LionWiki
==============

**LionWiki** is a minimalist Wiki engine (or CMS) programmed in PHP. It is extensible, templatable, file based (it doesn't need database like MySQL) and requires just one file to function (30 kb). It is suitable for small websites, personal notebooks or journals. 

Lionwiki-t2t is using a modified version of lionwiki.
